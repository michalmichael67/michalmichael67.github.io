# Bellybutton Diversity
## Project Overview
In this project, the goal was to create an interactive dashboard to analyze and identify species of bacteria for volunteers in a study. 

Once the user arrives on the page, he or she can select a volunteer ID from the dropdown menu and see 3 charts:
1. A bar chart showing the top 10 species of bacteria that were found in his/her bellybutton.
2. A guage showing the number of times the volunteer's belly button was washed in a given week.
3. A bubble chart showing all the bacterial species found in the bellybutton.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of the project was to provide this data for a company names Improbably Beef. Improbable Beef is a new plant-based beef company is looking for the best bacteria to create meat-like taste and texture for their product. 

In the bacteria search, scientists have hypothesized that the best bacteria for creating plant-based beef can be found in the belly button. In this dataset, volunteers had their belly buttons analyzed and the top 10 bacterial species were identified. This way, if Improbable Beef finds a bacteria candidate, the scientists will be able to identify which volunteers have that strain in their belly button.
